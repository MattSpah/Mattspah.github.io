 <!-- Wager #1 -->
<div class="wagerhead">
  <h2>Wager #1 - Friday, September 9, 2022</h2>
  </div>

<div class="wagerchoice">
  <h3>UCF Knights (-5.5) over Louisville Cardinals</h3>
  <p><img id="TeamLogo" src="KnightsCardinals.jpg">
    UCF hosts a Louisville team that was humbled by Syracuse last week.<br><br> The Knight's have a grizzled, semi-pro journeyman QB,
    and the line on this game has already moved out from its open at -3.5 points.
    </p>
    </div>

    <div class="result">
      <h3>LOSER</h3>
      <h3>-1.00 units</h3>
      <h3>Running total: -1.00 units</h3>
    </div>

    <!-- Wager #2 -->
<div class="wagerhead">
  <h2>Wager #2 - Saturday, September 10, 2022</h2>
   </div>

<div class="wagerchoice">
  <h3>Appalachian State (+18.5) against Texas A&M</h3>
  <p><img id="TeamLogo" src=AppStateA&M.jpg>
    App State is a tricky matchup here, and I don't think the Aggies have enough to cover.
    </p>
    </div>

    <div class="result">
      <h3>WINNER</h3>
      <h3>+0.84 units</h3>
      <h3>Running total: -0.16 units</h3>
    </div>

    <!-- Wager #3 -->
<div class="wagerhead">
  <h2>Wager #3 - Sunday, September 11, 2022</h2>
   </div>

<div class="wagerchoice">
  <h3>Baltimore Ravens (-6.5) at New York Jets</h3>
  <p><img id="TeamLogo" src=RavensJets.jpg>
    The Jets are the Jets, so there's that. <br><br> Plus, they're starting Joe Flacco this week. Ugh.
    </p>
    </div>

    <div class="result">
      <h3>WINNER</h3>
      <h3>+0.84 units</h3>
      <h3>Running total: 0.68 units</h3>
    </div>

    <!-- Wager #4 -->
<div class="wagerhead">
  <h2>Wager #4 - Saturday, September 17, 2022</h2>
   </div>

<div class="wagerchoice">
  <h3>BYU Cougars (+3.5) at Oregon Ducks</h3>
  <p><img id="TeamLogo" src=CougarsDucks.jpg>
    BYU has looked good enough to hang with Oregon. <br><br> Maybe this line will move out a bit for us before kickoff.
    </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Wager #5 -->
<div class="wagerhead">
  <h2>Wager #5 - Saturday, September 17, 2022</h2>
   </div>

<div class="wagerchoice">
  <h3>Kansas Jayhawks (+8.5) at Houston</h3>
  <p><img id="TeamLogo" src=JayhawksCougars.jpg>
    This is a nice chunk of points for Kansas, and I don't think Houston is all that great. <br><br> We'll hope this line doesn't move in.
    </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Wager #6 -->
<div class="wagerhead">
  <h2>Wager #6 - Saturday, September 17, 2022</h2>
   </div>

<div class="wagerchoice">
  <h3>Mississippi State Bulldogs vs. LSU Tigers over 52.5 points</h3>
  <p><img id="TeamLogo" src=BulldogsTigers.jpg>
    This is the modern college football era, and I think these two teams can score points. <br><br> Hope the field isn't swampy!
    </p>

    <!-- Wager #7 -->
<div class="wagerhead">
  <h2>Wager #7 - Saturday, September 17, 2022</h2>
   </div>

<div class="wagerchoice">
  <h3>Miami Hurricanes (+6) at Texas A&M Aggies</h3>
  <p><img id="TeamLogo" src=HurricanesAggies.jpg>
    Jimbo Fisher is a bum, and the Aggies are not good. <br><br> Look for this line to come in with late money on Miami.
    </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Wager #8 -->
<div class="wagerhead">
  <h2>Wager #8 - Saturday, September 17, 2022</h2>
   </div>

<div class="wagerchoice">
  <h3>Michigan State Huskies (+3.5) at Washington Huskies</h3>
  <p><img id="TeamLogo" src=SpartanHusky.jpg>
    Seems like these two teams are evenly matched. <br><br> We'll hope the breaks go for the Spartans.
